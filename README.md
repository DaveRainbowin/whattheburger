# whattheburger
the only game where you take over the universe with burgers
## starting
you start the game as the manager of a small, invisible restaurant in a small town.
you'll get a few customers every so often, but in the meantime, click the `Cook Burger` button and watch the bar fill up. once it's done you'll lose 2 buns and a slice of cheese, but you'll be able to serve a customer with that other button, the `Serve Burger` button.
